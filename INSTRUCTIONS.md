# Folding Cube Instructions

Follow these steps to build your own folding cube using blocks or other solid materials. Each step corresponds to an issue in this repository, modeling the idea of dividing a large task into smaller parts.

## Materials Needed

- **12 identical blocks** (wooden cubes, LEGO bricks, cardboard boxes, etc.)
- **Hinge material**: tape, small strips of cloth, or paper fasteners
- **A flat surface** to work on
- **Optional**: ruler, pencil, scissors (if you need to cut hinge material)

## Step 1: Gather Your Blocks

Take your 12 blocks and arrange them in a row. Make sure they are all the same size and shape. This step is about preparation—just like Gideon's army gathering their supplies.

## Step 2: Build the First Face

1. Place **four blocks** in a square formation (2 blocks wide, 2 blocks tall).
2. Connect the blocks by pressing them together (or using a small amount of glue if needed).
3. This square will become one face of your cube.

**Teaching note**: This is the first division of the task. Instead of thinking about the whole cube, we focus on just one side.

## Step 3: Construct the Hinges

A folding cube needs hinges that allow the faces to move. For each of the four vertical edges of the cube you'll build later, you'll need a hinge.

1. Cut or prepare **four small strips** of tape or cloth, each about the width of a block.
2. Attach one strip between two blocks that will form an edge, leaving a tiny gap so they can fold.
3. Repeat for the other three vertical edges.

**Important**: The hinges should be on the **outside** of the cube, not the inside, so the cube can fold inward.

## Step 4: Assemble the Cube

Now you'll connect the faces to form the cube.

1. Start with the first face you built (Face A).
2. Attach a second face (Face B) to the right edge of Face A using a hinge.
3. Attach a third face (Face C) to the top edge of Face A using a hinge.
4. Attach a fourth face (Face D) to the left edge of Face A using a hinge.
5. Attach a fifth face (Face E) to the bottom edge of Face A using a hinge.
6. Finally, attach the sixth face (Face F) to the back edges of Faces B, C, D, and E. This may require extra hinges or careful alignment.

## Step 5: Test the Fold

Gently press on opposite corners of the cube. It should collapse inward, folding flat. If it doesn't fold smoothly, check that your hinges are loose enough and that all faces are connected correctly.

## Tips for Success

- Work slowly and double‑check each connection.
- If using tape, don't make it too sticky—you might need to adjust.
- If a block falls off, just reattach it. Mistakes are part of learning!
