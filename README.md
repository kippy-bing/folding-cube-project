# The Folding Cube Project: Division and Creation

Welcome, students and creators! This repository is an interactive lesson plan that teaches an important life skill: **breaking big tasks into smaller, manageable parts**—just like Gideon did with his army.

## The Story of Gideon and His Army

In the ancient story, Gideon was a leader with a large army facing a powerful enemy. Instead of attacking all at once, he divided his army into smaller groups, each with a specific task. By working together in coordinated teams, they achieved victory. This project follows the same principle: we'll build a folding cube by dividing the construction into clear, simple steps.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Division of Labor**: How to take a complex goal (building a cube) and split it into smaller, achievable tasks.
2. **Step‑by‑Step Process**: Following instructions one piece at a time.
3. **Creative Collaboration**: Adding your own personal touch and sharing ideas with others.

## How to Use This Project

1. Start by reading the step‑by‑step instructions in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md).
2. Follow the issues (listed below) in order—each issue is one small step of the build.
3. After you've built your basic cube, join the **Creative Challenge** (Issue #5) to decorate and personalize your design.
4. Share your creation by creating a branch and submitting a pull request (see “How to Share Your Ideas” below).

## How to Share Your Ideas

We want to see your creativity! If you have a decoration idea or a modification to the cube design, here’s how you can share it:

1. **Create a new branch** from `main` with a descriptive name (for example `sara‑star‑pattern` or `liam‑colorful‑blocks`).
2. **In your branch**, create a new file called `MY_DESIGN.md` that describes your idea. You can also modify the `cube_design_template.txt` file if you prefer.
3. **Submit a Pull Request** to merge your branch into `main`. In the PR description, explain your creative choice and mention that it relates to **Issue #5**.

Your submission will be reviewed and celebrated—just like a teacher celebrating a student’s work!

## Project Issues (Our Division of Tasks)

The building process is broken down into the following issues. Click on each to see the detailed instructions.

| Issue | Title | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| #1 | **[Gather Your Blocks: The First Step](https://github.com/kippy‑bing/folding‑cube‑project/issues/1)** | What materials you need to start. |
| #2 | **[Build the First Face: The First Division](https://github.com/kippy‑bing/folding‑cube‑project/issues/2)** | How to create the first side of the cube. |
| #3 | **[Construct the Hinges: The Second Division](https://github.com/kippy‑bing/folding‑cube‑project/issues/3)** | Making the cube foldable. |
| #4 | **[Final Assembly and Test: The Victory](https://github.com/kippy‑bing/folding‑cube‑project/issues/4)** | Connecting the parts and testing the fold. |
| #5 | **[Creative Challenge: Decorate Your Cube](https://github.com/kippy‑bing/folding‑cube‑project/issues/5)** | Personalize your cube with your own materials or design changes. |

## Getting Started

Clone this repository, read the instructions, and start with Issue #1. Have fun, and remember: every big project is just a series of small steps!

**Teacher’s Note**: This repository is a living lesson plan. It shows how professional tools (like GitHub) can help us organize work, collaborate, and celebrate creativity. Just as Gideon’s army divided to conquer, we divide to create!
